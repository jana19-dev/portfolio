Dot Porter, in collaboration with Alberto Campagnolo, created VisColl to visualize collation structures alongside digitized images of manuscript leaves. During the Digital Tools for Manuscript Studies project, the Old Books New Science Lab and Information Technology Services at University of Toronto Libraries built a web-based application in collaboration with Porter and Campagnolo based upon their model. It produces detailed and downloadable collation diagrams.

Built using ReactJS + Redux powered by a Rails API backend. We used MongoDB to store the data and shared NFS storage for the images.
